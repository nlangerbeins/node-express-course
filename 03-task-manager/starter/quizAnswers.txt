3.You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
We use for that 'dotenv' package, what loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env, allowing application to access them.

How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
We need to use for that .gitignore, where we storage .env file with all secret variables. That ensures that the .env file will not be pushed to GitHub.
